# Problem 1

# ⚡ Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## 🧠 Problem Overview

We aim to compute the **equivalent resistance** between two points in a resistor network using **graph theory**. A resistor network can be modeled as an **undirected, weighted graph**, where:

- **Nodes** represent junctions,
- **Edges** represent resistors,
- **Weights** on edges are the resistance values.

---

## 🛠️ Approach

We solve this problem using two main techniques:

### 🔗 1. Graph Simplification

We iteratively reduce the graph using:

- **Series reduction**: Combine resistors in a line.
- **Parallel reduction**: Combine resistors across the same two nodes.

### 🧬 2. Laplacian Matrix Method

When simplification is not enough (e.g. loops or complex topology), we use the Laplacian matrix of the graph and compute resistance via:

$$
R_{eq}(a, b) = (e_a - e_b)^T L^+ (e_a - e_b)
$$

Where:

- **L** is the Laplacian matrix,  
- **L⁺** is its pseudoinverse,  
- **eₐ** and **e_b** are indicator vectors for nodes **a** and **b**.

## ⚙️ Efficiency Analysis

| Method         | Complexity | Best Use Case                        |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Simplification | \$O(E)\$   | Tree-like or easily reducible graphs |
| Laplacian      | \$O(N^3)\$ | Arbitrary/complex graphs with loops  |

- Use simplification first for performance.
- Use Laplacian only if no more reduction is possible.
